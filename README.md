* Logical Operators

            &&	            logical and
            ||	            logical or
            !	                    logical not

* Bitwise Operators

            &	            AND	
            |	            OR	
            ~	            NOT	
            ^	            XOR	
            <<	  left shift	
            >>	  right shift	
            >>>	  unsigned right shift	

## For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.
* Arithmetic operations

            let a = 3;
            let x = (100 + 50) * a;

            Result is x = 450

            let a = 10;
            let x = (100 - 50) / a;

            Result is x = 5
* Assignment operators

            let x = 10;
                x += 5;

            Result is x = 15

             let x = 10;
                 x *= 5;

            Result is x=50

* Comparison operators

            let x = 5;
            x == 10

            Result is false

            x != 8

            Result is true

* Logical operators


            let x = 6; 
            let y = 3;

            (x == 5 || y == 5)

            Result is false

            (x == 5 && y == 5)

            Result is false

* Bitwise operators


            5 $ 1

            Result is 1

            5 | 1

            Result is 5
## Result of the following code:
 ```
 for( let i=1; i< 20; i+=7) {
    console.log(i);
}
```
                1
                8
                15
